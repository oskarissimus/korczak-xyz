C                        D
So, so you think you can tell
            a                     G
Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain?
                     D                       C
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
               a                          G
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?

C                           D
Did they get you to trade
                          a
Your heroes for ghosts?
                     G
Hot ashes for trees?
                      D
Hot air for a cool breeze?
                  C
Cold comfort for change?
               a
Did you exchange
                           G
A walk on part in the war,
D                      C
For a lead role in a cage?

C                               D
How I wish, how I wish you were here.
          a
We're just two lost souls
                   G
Swimming in a fish bowl,
D
Year after year,
                          C
Running over the same old ground.
               a
What have we found
                  G
The same old fears.
          C              D    G
Wish you were here.
