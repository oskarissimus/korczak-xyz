Dashing through the snow.
      D                    e
In a one horse open sleigh.

Over fields we go.

Laughing all the way.

Bells on bobtail ring.
D                   e
Making spirits bright,
                      A
What fun it is to ride and sing.
A                      D
sleighing song tonight.

Hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way.

Oh, what fun it is to ride.
      E             A
In a one horse open sleigh
