C                        D
So, so you think you can tell
            a                     G
Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain?
                     D                       C
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
               a                          G
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk on part in the war,
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl,
Year after year,
Running over the same old ground.
What have we found
The same old fears.
