```song
D
Dashing through the snow.
      D                    e
In a one horse open sleigh.
                   A
Over fields we go.
                     D
Laughing all the way.
D
Bells on bobtail ring.
D                   e
Making spirits bright,
                      A
What fun it is to ride and sing.
A                      D
sleighing song tonight.

D
Hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells,
D
Jingle all the way.
G                    D
Oh, what fun it is to ride.
      E             A
In a one horse open sleigh, hey
