C                   F              D7
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
           C
And I say it's all right

C                          F                G
Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
C                             F                     G
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

C                   F              D7
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
          C
And I say it's all right

C                             F             G
Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
C                             F                     G
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here

C                   F              D7
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
          C
And I say it's all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes... x5

C                           F             G
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
C                             F                     G
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear

C                   F              D7
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
          C
And I say it's all right

C                   F              D7
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
C
It's all right
