G                   C              A7
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
           G
And I say it's all right

G                          C                D
Little darling, its been a long cold lonely winter
G                             C                     D
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

G                   C              A7
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
          G
And I say it's all right

G                             C             D
Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
G                             C                     D
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here

G                   C              A7
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
          G
And I say it's all right

g7   F    C           G
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes... x5

G                           C             D
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
G                             C                     D
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear

G                   C              A7
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
          G
And I say it's all right

G                   C              A7
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
G
It's all right
