                  Once upon a time I wrote a front-end of web app in pure JavaScript with a little help of jQuery. It
                  was a quick way to start. However, when my project grew I noticed a sad consequence of my approach:
                  the code after just about a year was total Spagetti!

                <h2>Vanilla JS - gateway drug</h2>
                <p>I thank that some developers start with JS this way.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Oh! I can have button just by typing <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> in my HTML file! Great! Let’s see
                    how do I make it do something after clicking.
                  </li>
                  <li>So I use JavaScript for that [BE CAREFUL]</li>
                  <li>Let’s add some <code>onClick="alert('clicked')"</code> attribute to my button</li>
                  <li>
                    Then after some time You find out about [DANGEROUS] <code>getElementById()</code>. At this point a
                    real madness about Vanilla JS begins…
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  When I write code, I often have a feeling about what it should do. Sometimes of course there is some
                  specification, but my inner hacker always wants something to be done by just written code. This is why
                  using <code>getElementById()</code> is so tempting every time. Just define id for element, than
                  copy-paste some code from Stack Overflow, and boom! Work is done. However creating an app this way
                  leads to anger, anger leads to hate and hate leads to spaghetti code.

                <h2>Dark times</h2>
                <p>
                  Ok, so I managed to deploy my freshly created legacy code to production. Did I mention I had no code
                  review whatsoever? Surprisingly this code worked more often than not, and nobody asked for too much
                  changes in it, so I leaved it for about 6 months. After that stability of the app came into question,
                  and I was wondering about fixing things, improving compatibility with browsers, etc. I didn’t even
                  want to look at it. It was about 900 lines in pure JS with atrocities like
                  <code>getElementById()</code> everywhere. I heard about this great React. That it is easy and
                  powerful. However, I never was into front-end so I didn’t start learning it. After watching some
                  videos on YouTube about it, I got grasp of key concepts of React. As it grew on me, I decided to get
                  out of this Legacy-Hell created by myself. <img alt="React is the way" />
                </p>
                <h2>Quickstart with React</h2>
                <p>
                  When I got basic concepts of React - components, state, props everything started to get brighter. I
                  finally could make some sensible modules, isolate thing from each other, use some nice architecture
                  and hierarchy. Not only that! After making Hello World in React it was clear to me that creating
                  front-end this way is even easier than in vanilla JS! In about a week I was able to get rid of ugly
                  900 lines of my own legacy and replace it with fresh React code.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every time when I learned new feature of React I really appreciate its design. It is great! Use React!
