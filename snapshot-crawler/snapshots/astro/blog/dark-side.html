                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>
                  Every Pink Floyd fan knows the album Dark Side Of The Moon. Many people who don’t even know the album
                  are familiar with its iconic cover. It’s very simple - it features a diagram of white light being
                  split into a spectrum by a prism. It’s an interesting phenomenon. Those who aren’t familiar with it
                  may wonder how it’s possible - white light isn’t associated with any color, it’s neutral - it can only
                  be brighter or darker. However, as it turns out, all the colors of the rainbow are hidden within it.
                </p>
                <h2>Prism</h2>
                <p>
                  Since I was a child, I wanted to conduct this experiment, but as I got older I forgot about my
                  childhood dreams and many other things lingered on the dusty shelves of the past.
                </p>
                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>
                  It is said that music soothes the savage beast, but when I played music that I liked for my
                  girlfriend, we quickly got into a conversation about our taste in music. Specifically, we talked about
                  songs that we both liked and could listen to together. Suffice it to say, initially it was a short
                  list that included just DSOTM and nothing else. As it turned out, I started playing Pink Floyd’s
                  recordings from this album multiple times a day. Each time it was an interesting journey, especially
                  when it was played from beginning to end.
                </p>
                <h2>Cover</h2>
                <p>
                  To complete the experience, at some point, I was struck by the idea that perhaps the diagram of the
                  split light does not accurately represent the actual color components of white light. I had only seen
                  the cover on a smartphone or computer screen. As we know, colors on such screens are created by
                  combining red, green, and blue. The human eye is sensitive only to these colors, so it happens that in
                  this way it is possible to “trick” the visual organ into seeing a color like yellow when there is no
                  wave of light with the corresponding length to the yellow color in the emitted light from the screen.
                  So we can say that we see that color, but it’s not really there.
                </p>
                <h2>Violet</h2>
                <p>
                  Basically, it’s not a big problem. From experience, we know that “tricking” the eye by modifying the
                  intensity of three colors to be able to see millions of colors works very well. It’s difficult to say
                  that there’s not enough color while browsing the internet or doing anything else on a screen.
                  Nevertheless, I wanted to conduct this experiment, to experience my own little rainbow and determine
                  for myself if I was missing anything. The most interesting part of it all turned out to be purple -
                  the color at the very end of the spectrum. It cannot be experienced on an electronic screen. For one
                  reason or another, the source of blue light has a longer wavelength - it is bluer. In natural
                  conditions, of course, that color exists - it’s kind of an ink color.
                </p>
                <h2>Setup</h2>
                <p>To conduct the experiment, I ordered the necessary components:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Prism</li>
                  <li>10W 12V halogen bulb</li>
                  <li>Power bank</li>
                  <li>12V USB-C Power Delivery terminal</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  To be able to observe the splitting of light, it’s important that the light beam that falls on the
                  prism isn’t too large (cross-section) and that the rays of this beam are parallel (as much as
                  possible). In the first iteration of the prototype, to obtain a parallel beam of light, I enclosed the
                  bulb in a box. I made a hole of a few millimeters in diameter in it. The bulb was positioned several
                  centimeters away from the hole so that the rays that emerged from it were approximately parallel.
                </p>
                <h2>Setting up the prism</h2>
                <p>
                  As it turned out, it was not an easy task. In such improvised conditions, with initially low
                  brightness of the beam, obtaining the splitting of light was quite challenging. I had to adjust the
                  prism a bit to get the angle and location of the beam hitting the prism right.
                </p>
                <h2>Observations</h2>
                <p>
                  Initially, I observed the split light on a sheet of paper. It was satisfying at first, but I wanted to
                  see more. I decided to look directly into the prism. I quickly estimated in my head that the bulb had
                  a power of 10W and that I wouldn’t blind myself by looking directly at it. Additionally, the split
                  light was just a fraction of the light passing through the hole in the box, which in turn allowed only
                  a fraction of the total light generated by the bulb. In summary, I concluded that it would be safe for
                  my eyes.
                </p>
                <h2>Looking at the spectrum</h2>
                <p>
                  Directly experiencing the spectrum is something that I recommend to everyone. The entire spectrum was
                  a few centimeters long. I moved my head from right to left and the colors changed. It may seem like
                  nothing big, but the colors were pure, separate yet connected. It’s hard to say if from a
                  physiological point of view there’s a difference between looking at yellow generated by a smartphone
                  screen and looking at yellow as part of the spectrum. I suppose not. But my impression and experience
                  of the spectrum as something real and existing was an important complement to DSOTM. There, I also
                  noticed the purple color that I mentioned before, which is difficult to see in other conditions,
                  especially in such purity.
                </p>
                <h2>System drawbacks</h2>
                <p>
                  Firstly, there wasn’t enough of the rainbow. It could only be seen in a dark room. Ultimately, I
                  wanted to have an interactive decoration that could be admired not only in the dark. Secondly, I had a
                  point light source - it would be difficult to visualize it on the screen in a similar way to the DSOTM
                  cover. Thirdly, the setup was quite large and not very compact, making it impractical to use as
                  decoration.
                </p>
                <h2>Improvements</h2>
                <p>
                  An important feature of the setup for me was the battery-powered operation - so it wouldn’t be
                  necessary to connect it to the power grid during use. Hence, the 12V voltage of the chosen bulb.
                </p>
                <h3>Bulb</h3>
                <div>
                  <div><img alt="Bulbs" /> Bulbs</div>
                </div>
                <p>
                  I tried a stronger bulb - a 20W one - but for unknown reasons, the power bank would shut off - even
                  though theoretically, it can supply up to 30W (including approximately 2A at 12V), so it should work.
                  Perhaps it has to do with the fact that the bulb has lower resistance when turning on (warming up)
                  than when shining, therefore, it requires more power and amperage. Maybe it’s an entirely different
                  issue related to communication between the power-delivery terminal and the power bank. Anyway, I
                  decided to stick with the 10W 12V halogen bulb with a G4 connection.
                </p>
                <h3>Mirror</h3>
                <p>
                  To increase the intensity of the light beam without increasing the power of the bulb, I decided to use
                  a reflector. For this purpose, I bought two flashlights and a parabolic mirror. From a practical point
                  of view, the most sensible choice was to use the reflector from an old signal flashlight. It was just
                  a piece of stamped metal with a hole for the bulb in the middle. The mirror from the second flashlight
                  was made of plastic and melted from the heat of the bulb. The parabolic mirror initially seemed the
                  most promising. It had a very smooth surface and seemed to have a glass coating, but the lack of a
                  hole in the middle made it more difficult to use in the setup.

                <h3>Lens</h3>
                <p>
                  I also asked in the hackerspace if anyone had an idea for improving the circuit, and one of my
                  colleagues suggested using a lens. It seems quite reasonable. But I don’t have a lens and I decided
                  not to pursue that route for now.
                </p>
                <h3>Slit</h3>

                </div>
                <p>
                  Here, I was inspired by optical setups used in school experiments. I noticed that a prism typically
                  has a slit on one of its faces. By using a slit instead of a circular opening, I get more rainbows :)
                </p>
                <h2>Iteration 2</h2>
                <div>
                  <div><img alt="Iteration 2 demo" /> Iteration 2 demo</div>
                </div>
                <p>
                  Using the improvements I mentioned earlier, I built another cardboard circuit using hot glue. It
                  worked surprisingly well. There were only two remaining issues - the inability to adjust the
                  reflector’s position relative to the bulb, and the imprecise dimensions of the slit (cut with a
                  wallpaper knife in cardboard). So, I decided it was time for another prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>Iteration 3</h2>
                <p>
                  I went to the hackerspace. Here it is worth mentioning the very helpful members of this community. I
                  wanted to cut something with a laser on a 2mm HDF board - and “boom”, there was a friend who showed me
                  everything and now I know how to use this machine. The designs were quite simple and are in a public
                  repository on GitHub. The whole thing consists of five 9x9cm squares laser-cut into the HDF board,
                  each with the appropriate features. Two squares are used for beam formation - both containing a slit
                  1mm wide. The next two squares are mirror holders. The final square is a holder for the G4 socket in
                  which the bulb is placed. The whole thing is held together on M5 threaded rods. It turned out
                  surprisingly well - I managed to solve the biggest problems from iteration 2 - the slit was precise,
                  and I had the ability to adjust the mirror position relative to the bulb in such a way that it was at
                  approximately its focal point.

                <h2>Finalization</h2>
                <p>
                  I thought maybe I could improve it even more, but the consensus was that it was good enough, so I
                  decided to move on to the final phase of the project. To do this, I bought a white furniture board
                  measuring 70 x 70 cm. Using hot glue, I mounted the prism, light source, and power bank on the board.
                  I connected the wires, and voila - everything worked more or less as I had imagined. The problematic
                  part was where to place this decoration. My apartment is not that big, and I can’t drill holes in the
                  walls without asking the landlord. So, I temporarily placed the decoration above the toilet, and it
                  got a new name - “Dark Side Of The Piss”.

                <h2>What’s next?</h2>
                <p>
                  Maybe someday I’ll improve it, but for now, I consider the project closed. One of my friends who is
                  into music was inspired by my project. He recorded an intro rhythmically similar to the beginning of
                  “Money” from DSOTM. Instead of using sounds associated with money, he used sounds associated with the
                  placement of the decoration.
