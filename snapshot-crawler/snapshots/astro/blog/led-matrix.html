                <p><img alt="Tetris played on my DIY LED matrix" /></p>
                <p>
                  Sometime in early 2018 I started building my DIY LED matrix. Plan was quite simple. Take led strip
                  from China, put it on cardboard, and connect it into arduino. I knew it was possible, because i saw
                  projects like that many times on YouTube.
                </p>
                <h2>Original plan</h2>
                <p>
                  I wanted to have 10x30 pixels on my matrix, maybe not enough to display images, but sufficient to play
                  some simple games, like tetris or pong, maybe display some animations, or just plain colors. It would
                  have dimensions like 33 x 100 cm. When LEDs from China arrived, I was surprised to notice, that I cant
                  control them individually, but every 3 of them are connected in series. It meant that instead of 300
                  pixels, I would only have 100. Also every pixel would have 10×10 cm diameters, giving me matrix with
                  size of 1mx1m.
                  <img alt="Led strip" />
                  These are very good LEDs. However I laughed for a while when i noticed that “they couldn’t imagine how
                  beautiful life without me”. A little dark.
                </p>
                <h2>Playing with LEDs</h2>
                <p>
                  When my packages finally arrived from China, I quickly connected them to arduino and started playing
                  with them.

                <p>
                  Well, after having some fun with LED strips it was time to glue together some cardboard, and make
                  backplate with size 1x1m, Than I plugged everything to power supply and arduino, and was truly amazed
                  with LED control software

                  I separated pixels with stripes of cardboard secured to the backplate with hot glue. After that I
                  covered it with foil, to disperse light, and create sensation of square pixels.

                <p>
                  When hardware was ready i opened Arduino IDE and implemented Snake and Tetris, because i thought those
                  are appropriate games for screen with resolution of 10px x 10px. I have source code for that somewhere
                  on old hard drive, and I will share it, when I will find it.
